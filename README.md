Don't forget to patch cx_Freeze library 
if you use python 3.7+ like I do!

-------------------------------------------

New in this build:
- updated schedule: reduced number of trains for levels 69+
- updated construction time and price for some tracks
- added money target button with eye symbol on it to constructor screen: 
now player can turn it on and track if there is enough money to build a track without opening constructor screen
- increased experience and money target progress bar width
- minor fixes and improvements
