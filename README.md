rssim.py run requires:

python 3.7

pygame 1.9.4

-------------------------------------------

rssim.exe build (python setup.py build) also requires:

cx_Freeze 5.1.1 with py3.7 fix

-------------------------------------------

New in this build:
- game config in .ini format (however, i don't recommend changing anything here 
if you don't exactly know what you are doing and for what)
- updated artwork
- added app logo
- removed redundant console window upon app launch
